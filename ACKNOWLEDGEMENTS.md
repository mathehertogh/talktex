# Acknowledgements

## Inspiration
This project was created within the Multimedia Systems course 2021 (Leiden University) by Dr. M.S.K. Lew and Dr. E.M. Bakker. Therefore, we would like to thank them for giving this course, since without it, the project would not exist. 

## Meson and general project structure
For the general project structure of [the compiler](src/compiler), we took
(approved) inspiration from a [project](https://github.com/alexandru-uta/liacs-coco-public) by Sebastiaan Alvarez Rodrigruez
and Mariska IJpelaar on Compiler Construction, for the Compiler Construction
course 2021 (Leiden University) by Dr. A. Uta MSc. Since the structure of that project was
designed by Sebastiaan, we would like to thank him especially, since this saved
us a lot of time
