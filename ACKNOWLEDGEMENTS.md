## Meson and general project structure
For the general project structure of [the compiler](src/compiler), we took
(approved) inspiration from a (private) project by Sebastiaan Alvarez Rodrigruez
and Mariska IJpelaar on Compiler Construction, for the Compiler Construction
course 2021 (Leiden University). Since the structure of that project was
designed by Sebastiaan, we would like to thank him especially, since this saved
us a lot of time
